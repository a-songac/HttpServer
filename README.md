## INFO 
- Execute python script (make sure it is executable): ./HttpServer.py
- for usage directives, execute: ./HttpServer.py -h
- To test the concurrency, use --delay-writing flag. This will cause all write operation
  to last 10 seconds.  This allows to launch other requests on the same resource and
  witness concurrency handling behavior
